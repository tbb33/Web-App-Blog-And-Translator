# Web-App-Blog-And-Translator
 
## This web app has 2 features to show what I've learned using Django - a blog with an admin interface and translator. 

To run this app, download all files and in terminal type "python manage.py runserver" and then click on the link to open the web page on your local server. Ensure you have the proper libraries installed (i.e. Django and googletrans). 

I learned how to:
1. create web apps while working with a database by using Django
   - create a database model for a web app
   - stylize using bootstrap
3. add more than 1 app to a single site
4. overall understanding of web app architecture and steps to create any web app
5. use template inheritance, template tags, and template filters
7. process user data through Forms
